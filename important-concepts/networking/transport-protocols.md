# Transport Protocols

TCP/IP, Which indicates that TCP protocol runs over an IP network.

TCP is responsible for the transport of packets, while IP is responsible for the logical addressing when sending information over TCP.

1. A sequence number (32-bit) is sent by tcp client, indicating how much data has been sent for the session.
2. An acknowledgement number is sent by the TCP server, indicating that it has received the data and is ready for the next segment.&#x20;

TCP flag is a control bit on the data packet that indicates different connection states and/or information about how the packet should be handled.

Flags are SYN, ACK and FIN
